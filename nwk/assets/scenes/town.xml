    <text><![CDATA[You find yourself within the town square of the town of Nightwrest. From the center of town you clearly see a small castle which overlooks the town from a densely forested hill. To the west you make out a tavern, a place to recoup and catch up on the local gossip. For the pious, a quaint church can be found to the east. You see an old battle tower to the south which dominates the skyline of the forest known as the Duskwood.]]>
